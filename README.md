# Save My Data
#### Simple and easy fast way to work handel your data. [Save my data](https://SaveMyData.Sariahoubi.com)


## Motivation
While I was helping a friend with a project of his which consists of simple HTML/CSS page and some javascript to create a page to collect some survey data.
He wanted to save the data he collected in some way but dose not want to get technical with it nor wants to pay for any paid service so after trying some simple waies such as saving in some kind of a file and then reading it later.
I did not like the way he was saving it and wanted to create a samll service which makes storing, reading, editing and exporting data fast, easy and secure.

## The Concept
Save my data exposes Rest API endpoints on which its takes any structure of data in JSON fromat from the user and creates the database and tables using MongoDb and from there the user can do any CRUD opperations on them, which can be done also in the main web page which can  export the data on the go to Excel, CSV and much more that are being added.

## API-End Points
Since the project is not yet in the production phase I will wait until everything is ready to document them.
But for any one who wants to try it you can go through the SaveMyData folder and go to controllers--> API and there you can find all the exposed end points.

## Future
I am still actively developing in the website and working on getting to the next mile stone :checkered_flag: which includes:
1. CRUD operation on databases
1. Exporting data in CSV
1. API documantation

Made with :heart:
