# Save My Data
#### Simple and easy fast way to work handel your data. [Save my data](https://SaveMyData.Sariahoubi.com)


## Motivation
While I was helping a friend with a project of his which consists of simple HTML/CSS and some javascript to create a page for collecting some survey data, He wanted to save the data he collected in some way but dose not want to get too technical with all the database stuff nor wants to pay for any service so after he tried some simple ways which solved parts of the problem but non of them he ended up liking.<br/>
Nor did I like them and wanted to help so I create a service which makes storing, reading, editing and exporting data fast, easy and secure.

## The Concept
Save my data exposes Restful API endpoints on which its takes any structure of data in JSON fromat from the user and creates the database and tables using MongoDb and from there the user can do any CRUD operations on them.<br/>which can be done also in the main web page with the ability to export the data on the go to Excel, CSV and much more that are being added.

## API-End Points
Since the project is not yet in production phase I will wait until everything is ready to document them.<br/>
But for any one who wants to try it you can go through the SaveMyData folder and go to controllers--> API and there you can find all the exposed end points.

## Future
I am still actively developing in the website and working on getting to the next mile stone :checkered_flag: which includes:
1. CRUD operation on databases.
1. Exporting data in CSV.
1. API documantation.

Made with :heart:
